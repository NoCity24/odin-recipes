    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy spaghetti and meat sauce recipe takes just a few minutes of prep and then a low simmer on the stove for a deep, meaty-flavored, homemade spaghetti for the best family favorite dinner</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef. I use 85% lean ground angus beef for my sauce so it still has flavor but not a lot of fat. My sister has taken to using ground turkey, also a great option.</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce. Plain is best to create a tomato bath for the other ingredients to infuse.</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes. You could use canned whole tomatoes and then crush with your hands and fingers. But mom’s recipe says diced so that’s what I do.</li>
        <li>Tomato paste. This gives the sauce body and also a little sweetness.</li>
        <li>Beef broth. Another layer of meatiness. My sister amended her recipe to use condensed, but I used regular here.</li>
        <li>Canned mushrooms. Typically I will always use fresh mushrooms in recipes, but this is one time I never, ever, ever do. There’s just something about the canned version that becomes my favorite part of the sauce, and the reason I typically double the amount the recipe calls for.</li>
        <li>A splash of wine. Mom says to use the empty mushroom can as your measurement guide. The key to cooking with wine is to purchase one that is of the same quality you’d be willing to drink. I’d say look for a bottle that costs around $10 or so (I tend to use a blended red or Pinot noir in this spaghetti recipe).</li>
        <li>Onion, celery and fresh garlic. They’re always lollying around the refrigerator crisper waiting to be used.</li>
        <li>Dried herbs, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of sugar for sweetness. Don’t skip out on the bay leaves, they make a huge difference.</li>
        <li>Dried whole cloves! My mom learned this trick from her friend Virginia, and adding a few whole cloves was the secret ingredient I’d been missing lo these many years. My mom uses 5-6 cloves but my husband prefers four. The cloves give it an earthy, spiced flavor that’s not often easy to place. It’s a total surprise when I tell people they’re in there, or if they discover one on their own hidden in their spaghetti-sauced bite if I forget or can’t find them to fish them out before serving.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the beef. Drain off any excess fat, then, throw in the chopped celery, onion, and garlic and cook until the vegetables soften.</li>
        <li>Boil and simmer. Dump the rest of the homemade pasta sauce ingredients into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the spaghetti sauce is boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer on the stove for 3 hours. I know 3 hours sounds like forever, but that’s how long it takes to make a rich, flavorful meat sauce. Just do what the Italians do, (fuhgetaboutit).</li>
        <li>Cook your noodles. Once the homemade spaghetti sauce has had time to simmer, all that’s left to do is boiling the spaghetti noodles according to package instructions and dish it up!</li>
    </ol>
